BezierEditor
============

BezierEditor is a simple tool I wrote to create bezier paths. Right now the tool supports:
- creation of bezier paths of arbitrary lengths
- bezier points (start, end, control) are modifiable via drag and drop
- bezier paths can be mirrored horizontally and vertically
- the list of bezier paths can be exported/imported to/from a .bezier file (csv)

It is still a bit rough around the edges but right now it completly fulfills the requirements I have.
